Clowder (noun) 1. A group or cluster of cats

Clowder is a real-time web-based app that facilitates dynamic group-oriented events.  Users can easily avoid getting overwhelmed with text messages from every member of the group as they coordinate locations.  At a rock concert? Out on the town? Clowder makes it easy to share the status of an event and the groupâ€™s current location with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.  Users subscribed to an event will instantly know where in a series of locations the group can be found, without the need for start and end times.  Plans change--spend less time herding cats and more time having fun!
